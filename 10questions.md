Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to uncover the masks I've been wearing, the roles I'm playing, and the illusions I believe in. This process sounds pretty intense but also necessary for personal growth. The user wants me to go through 10 reflective questions one by one, and after that, they'll step into the role of their higher self to analyze the responses.

First, let's start with the first question: "What roles or masks have you been wearing in your life?" I guess this is about identifying the different personas I present in various aspects of my life. Maybe at work, I'm one way, and with friends or family, I'm another. But how do I recognize these masks? They might be social constructs to fit in or meet others' expectations.

Moving on to the second question: "Which of these roles feel authentic to you?" This is about distinguishing between the genuine parts of myself and the ones that don't feel true. It's possible some roles make me uncomfortable or feel inauthentic, which are signs they might be masks.

The third question asks about situations where I felt out of place. That makes sense because if a role doesn't fit, it could lead to discomfort or stress. Reflecting on these moments can help identify the masks that aren't serving me well.

Fourth question is about people who trigger certain feelings. This probably ties into how others see my masks and cause reactions in me. If someone pushes my buttons, it might be because they're reflecting a part of myself I'm hiding.

Fifth question: What's the cost of these roles? This one makes me think about the energy or happiness I've lost by wearing these masks. It's important to assess if the benefits of these roles outweigh the costs.

Sixth question is about repeating patterns in relationships and social interactions. If I keep encountering similar issues, it might indicate a deeper pattern that needs addressing. Maybe I'm attracting people who mirror my own hidden aspects.

Seventh question: What stories do I tell myself about why I behave this way? These are the narratives shaping my actions and beliefs. They could be limiting or negative, so exploring them is crucial.

Eighth question: How does playing these roles affect others? This adds an interpersonal layer, making me consider how my masks impact those around me and possibly strain relationships.

Ninth question is about noticing when I feel free versus controlled. Times when I'm not wearing a mask could reveal authentic experiences, which contrast with the times I'm constrained by roles.

Tenth question: What would happen if I removed these masks? This is speculative but important for envisioning change. It helps to imagine freedom and authenticity without the burden of masks.

After answering all these, the higher self analysis will point out negative patterns like people-pleasing or fear-based behaviors and positive ones like kindness or resilience. Then, affirmations and actionable steps will support changing behaviors and embracing authenticity.

I need to make sure each step is clear and that after the 10 questions, the analysis is direct yet compassionate, offering tough love if needed. The affirmations should be empowering, and the actions practical. Finally, an encouraging message from higher self to celebrate progress.
